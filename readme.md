Summary:
This project examines the relationship between alcohol consumption and traffic accidents in the U.S., focusing on per capita alcohol consumption. By analyzing trends across states, the study aims to provide data-driven insights to inform public health policies on road safety and alcohol regulations.

Research highlights the strong link between alcohol consumption and traffic accidents. In 2021, alcohol was a factor in 31% of U.S. traffic fatalities, causing over 13,000 deaths. However, inconsistencies in BAC testing, performed in only 38% of fatal crashes, suggest potential underreporting. Studies, such as those by Jiang et al. (2022) and Voas et al. (2020), emphasize the need for better data collection and analysis. They find regional alcohol consumption and specific periods, like weekends and holidays, are key predictors of accident frequency and severity.

This project leverages geospatial analysis to identify accident hotspots and map alcohol consumption to traffic accident rates. The goal is to enable targeted interventions that reduce alcohol-related road fatalities.
